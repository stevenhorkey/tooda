You will record two videos, describing what you’ve produced. The first one
should be roughly 90 seconds long2 This video will introduce what you’ve built,
and show it in action. It should include enough detail to demonstrate that
you’ve fulfilled the Firm Requirements above; for instance, if you are running
on a pair of EC2 servers (as I suspect that many of you are), then you should
perform an action on one server, switch to the other server, and see the result
of that action over there.


- Running on ec2, rds, and surge
- 

Your second video will describe the “interesting” feature that you added to
your project. It should be roughly 5 minutes long. Describe what the feature
is, and why it’s interesting. Show how you used it in your service. Include
some links (ideally, in the description, if you post on YouTube) to tutorials and
documentation. If you have time, maybe show a little snippet of your code,
showing how it works.
